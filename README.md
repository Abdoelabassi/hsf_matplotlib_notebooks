# Open in Google Colab

Each notebook should have a Google Colab button at the top so that you can try running the material. (You must have a google account for this to work)

You could also download an Add-on to your browser (Google Chrome or Firefox) :
- Search for "Open in Colab" as an Extension
- Download and install
- Go to the Github Repository, open the notebook
- Click on the Extension at the top of your broswer to open in Google Colab.
